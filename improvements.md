#### Suggested Improvements for the Project
- Migrate the codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript for improved type safety and maintainability.
- Introduce stricter ESLint rules to enforce consistent code quality and reduce potential bugs.
- Implement caching for infrequently changing resources (e.g., venue data, images) to enhance performance.
- Refactor duplicated UI elements into reusable components (e.g., create a NavMenu component for consistent use in the header and other areas).
- Add pagination to data-fetching logic to improve scalability and performance when handling large datasets.
- Use a component library like Hero UI (or a company-approved alternative) to maintain UI consistency and speed up development.
